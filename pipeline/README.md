# Meridian data pipeline

Python scripts (uv-managed) that populate `../data/meridian.db`, the SQLite
cache the Rust/Leptos app reads. They fetch and parse ESEF filings from public
sources and run offline / on a schedule — never at request time.

```
filings.xbrl.org ─▶ Python scripts ─▶ data/meridian.db ─▶ Rust/Axum ─▶ Leptos
```

## Setup

```bash
cd pipeline
uv sync
```

## Scripts

| Script                | What it does                                                                 | Network |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `src/db.py`           | Schema + upsert helpers (shared). `uv run python src/db.py` just inits it.    | none    |
| `src/fetch_filings.py`| Scan each seed country's filings on filings.xbrl.org and match each seed name to the actual filer, populating `entities` + `filings`. | filings.xbrl.org |
| `src/parse_xbrl_json.py`| Download each filing's XBRL-JSON extract and parse headline IFRS concepts into `financial_facts`. | filings.xbrl.org |
| `src/fetch_fx_rates.py`| Fetch ECB annual-average reference rates for the non-EUR currencies in the cache into `fx_rates` (for the comparator's currency conversion). | data-api.ecb.europa.eu |
| `src/diagnose_concepts.py`| One-shot report of which IFRS concepts each issuer tags (to extend the concept/alias map). | filings.xbrl.org |
| `src/seed_demo.py`    | Offline fixture: writes illustrative demo data (incl. a few FX rates) so the web app can be run without any network access. | none |

## Usage

Real data (needs outbound access to `filings.xbrl.org`):

```bash
uv run python src/fetch_filings.py      # entities + filings
uv run python src/parse_xbrl_json.py    # financial_facts
uv run python src/fetch_fx_rates.py     # fx_rates (optional; enables currency conversion)
```

Offline demo data (no network — for previewing the UI):

```bash
uv run python src/seed_demo.py
```

Both paths are idempotent; re-running refreshes the same rows.

## Schema (`data/meridian.db`)

- **entities** — `id, name, lei (unique), country`
- **filings** — `id, entity_id, reporting_date, filing_url, xbrl_json_url, country, validation_message_count`
- **financial_facts** — `id, entity_id, reporting_date, concept, value, currency`
- **fx_rates** — `currency, year, rate_per_eur` (ECB annual average, units per EUR)

Conventions: amounts stored as strings (no float rounding), IFRS concepts kept
as-is (`ifrs-full:Revenue`), currencies as ISO-4217 codes (`EUR`).

## Seed list

`fetch_filings.py` seeds ~39 large-cap issuers across 13 countries (NL, FR, ES,
IT, DK, FI, SE, NO, BE, PT, AT, IE, DE). For each country it scans the filings
index once and matches each seed name to the actual filer (most token overlap,
then fewest extra tokens — so the listed parent beats subsidiaries), taking the
LEI and canonical name from the index. German issuers are kept on purpose and
resolve to no filings, surfacing the coverage gap. Edit `SEED` to change the
universe.

## Parsed concepts

`ifrs-full:Revenue`, `ifrs-full:ProfitLoss`, `ifrs-full:Assets`,
`ifrs-full:Equity`, `ifrs-full:CashFlowsFromOperatingActivities`.

For each concept the parser keeps the current-year, top-line consolidated value:
the fact carrying only core xBRL-JSON dimensions (no segment/member axes) with
the latest period end.
